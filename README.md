How to use these resources

Most of the resources, such as presentations and documents, can be downloaded individually through this website. 
The NetLogo models, however, often need some accompanying data. The easiest way to run the models is to download this whole repository and extract the zip file.
Then the models can be run by loading them into NetLogo.

To get full use of the book and what is provided here we suggest you download and install:

NetLogo (Verson 6.2.2) https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml

If you have any questions, suggestions or want to contribute a model feel free to drop us a line.
